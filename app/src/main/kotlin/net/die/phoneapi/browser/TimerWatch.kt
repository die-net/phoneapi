/**
 * Whether a tab's timers still run. On an Android 11 phone, Chrome stopped a hidden tab's timers
 * about a minute after hiding it, well before pausing the page, so input seemed to work but a page
 * that reacts through timers never did, and nothing said why.
 *
 * Waiting for a timer before every input would cost about a second each, since Chrome runs a hidden
 * tab's timers at most once a second. So a check starts alongside each input, in the background,
 * and the next call on the tab reads its result. Checks run in an isolated world, so the page
 * cannot see them, and Chrome stops that world's timers along with the page's.
