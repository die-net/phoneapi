/**
 * A connection's write side: [base], which then calls [shutdown] once when it closes, so the client
 * sees the end of the stream as it would from a TCP socket. Ktor's channel over an `OutputStream`
 * only marks itself closed. After a WebSocket ends, CIO reads until the client hangs up, and a
 * client following RFC 6455 waits for the server to close first, so without this both wait.
