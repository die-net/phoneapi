/**
 * Catches a call from a session without the screen that brings an app forward, as docs/sharing.md
 * describes under "When something comes forward anyway". Android and Chrome block nearly all of
 * these, so this is a tripwire for workflows that rely on one, not something agents handle in
 * normal use.
 *
 * A change of top task during the call, or within [lateMs] after, with no screen call running or
 * started meanwhile, is the session's doing. The call fails with `took_screen`. A session that
 * caused it while no one held the screen gets the screen, so it can look and clean up. Otherwise
 * the app that was in front comes back, and the holder is told.
