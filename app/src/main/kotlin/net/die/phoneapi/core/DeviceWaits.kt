/**
 * Waits until [predicate] holds for the live device state, or [timeoutMs] passes. Screen and
 * keyguard are not broadcast for every change (a dismissal may not be), so every state change and
 * published event re-reads them. Subscribing to [DeviceStateTracker.state] delivers its current
 * value first, so a change between the caller's last check and the subscription is not lost. The
 * re-read publishes on that same flow, which emits again only when the summary actually changed.
